  <h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="intro">Hello, my name is Tyler, and I have a mix of hobbies.
<span class="sentence">I enjoy cooking and trying new things, so I decided to learn how to make better food outside.</span>
I normally use a propane grill, which limits the types of food I can make that will turn out well.</p>

<p>I recently acquired an electric smoker, which allows me to control how I smoke food. I use less wood and save money on propane.
Although, I did notice that the electric smoker requires finely chopped wood, which led me to experiment with new varieties of wood.
After getting used to the smoker, I decided to get a charcoal grill to give the food a better bark.</p>

<p>I’ve developed my own system that has drastically improved the food I make outside. I’ve made brisket, a whole turkey, sausages, 3-pound steaks, and pulled pork.
One of my friends and their family love my BBQ and often ask me to make pulled pork, which got me thinking about consistency—being able to reproduce a cook over and over.
To improve consistency, I got a scale and extra bottles to measure sauces and seasonings. I also keep notes on each cook and incorporate feedback.</p>

<p>With the new smoker and grill, I have the confidence to experiment with different types of meats and methods of cooking and marinating.
I’ve considered making an application to log all my cooks and blog the results. I have a rough idea of how I want to approach this project—I just need to find the time to commit to it.</p>
